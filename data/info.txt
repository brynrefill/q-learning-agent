The data correspond to graphs on:

- TQL tested with 4 different ε-decay values (.993, .995, .997, .999)
- DQN tested with 4 different ε-decay values (the same as above)
- DQN tested with 4 different batch size values (16, 32, 64, 128)
- comparison between TQL and DQN (ε-decay=.995 for both; batch_size=64 for DQN)

all four in both the deterministic environment and in the non-deterministic one (is_slippery=True).
